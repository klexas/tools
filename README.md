# Personal Tools & Scripts

This repository is just a collection of small scripts that I regularly use, tweak, and come back to over time. They live here mostly so I can version them with Git and keep them in one place.

Feel free to:
- Use any of these scripts as-is
- Copy, fork, or adapt them for your own setup
- Open PRs or share improvements if you think something could be better

Nothing here is guaranteed to be polished or production‑ready. Always read through a script before running it, and use it at your own risk.

Folder overview:
- `gaming/` – scripts related to game servers or tools (e.g. SteamCMD)
- `hosting/` – scripts for hosting and web server tasks (e.g. nginx, SSL)
- `ide/` – scripts and helpers for development environments and editors
- `misc/` – everything else that doesn’t fit neatly into the above

If you find something useful, great—enjoy and customize as you like.
